# Postmortem README

A postmortem is a process of analyzing and documenting a system outage or incident to identify the root cause, steps taken to resolve the issue, and measures to prevent future occurrences.

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the process of conducting a postmortem and provide guidance on creating an effective postmortem report.

## Process
The postmortem process generally consists of the following steps:

Detect and Respond to Incident: The incident or outage is detected, and the team responds to resolve the issue.

Conduct Initial Analysis: The team conducts an initial analysis to identify the cause of the issue and any immediate actions required to resolve it.

Document the Incident: The team documents the incident by gathering information about the events leading up to the incident, the impact of the incident, and the actions taken to resolve it.

Conduct a Root Cause Analysis: The team conducts a thorough root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the incident.

Develop and Implement Corrective and Preventive Actions: The team develops and implements corrective and preventive actions to prevent future incidents.

# Postmortem Report
The postmortem report is a detailed document that summarizes the incident, the root cause analysis, and the corrective and preventive actions taken. The report should be shared with relevant stakeholders, including management, customers, and other teams within the organization.

The report should contain the following information:

1. Summary of the Incident: A brief overview of the incident, including the start and end times, impact on the system or service, and the number of users affected.

2. Timeline of the Incident: A detailed timeline of events leading up to the incident and the actions taken to resolve it.

3. Root Cause Analysis: A detailed analysis of the underlying cause of the incident, including any contributing factors and recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future.

4. Corrective and Preventive Actions: A list of actions taken to resolve the incident and prevent future occurrences, including timelines and responsible parties.

5. Lessons Learned: A summary of lessons learned from the incident and recommendations for improving incident response processes.

## Conclusion
Conducting a postmortem is an essential part of incident response, and an effective postmortem report can help improve incident response processes and prevent future incidents. By following the postmortem process and creating a comprehensive postmortem report, teams can ensure that incidents are resolved quickly and effectively, and that systems and services remain reliable and resilient.
